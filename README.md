# Introduction to the Local Environment Setup Instructions

We believe that it's important for each student to have confidence in creating code on their own
computers. Many of our lessons also include feedback in the form of code tests - these will only
run in an environment set up for JavaScript and Ruby. For these reasons, we ask students to set
up their local environments as early as possible. The next set of lessons will walk through the
installing and configuring the tools you'll need. Separate instructions are provided for Mac and
Windows users, and an alternative environment setup is also provided if you run into any issues
setting up your local machine.

Local environment setup may take anywhere from 1 to 4 hours total depending on how fast your
computer is and your internet speeds. As you have time throughout the week, try to install each of
the tools and technologies listed in the setup instructions and write down any issues that you run
into. It is okay to install the programs over the course of a few days. 

If you encounter consistent issues while setting up your local environment, the alternative environment can
be used temporarily so you can continue working through the beginning of this course.

> **NOTE**: If you are using a Mac then you will work through the steps in the **MacOS Environment Setup** module and ignore the Windows set up. If you will be using a Windows-based PC then you can skip past the Mac set up and work through the steps in the **Windows Environment Setup** module.
